## git practice

auto generate js / some file
- commit and understand all git functions.


also have to work on `git-worktree`
atlassian has really cool documentation


## working on major project with other people

messing around with files.s

basic workflow

- main
- dev
- branch per person
  - akshay
  - dhruv
  - kalash
- we all rebase over the latest possible commit.
- or we have merges to avoid history changes?
- `git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD` (undo) a full rebase
